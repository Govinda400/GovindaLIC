## Differential Amplifier

A **differential amplifier** is an electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages. Unlike a regular amplifier that amplifies a single input, the differential amplifier compares the voltages and outputs a signal that is proportional to the difference.

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **Differential Gain**: Amplifies the difference between \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \).
2. **Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)**: Measures how well the amplifier rejects signals common to both inputs (noise or interference).
3. **Input Impedance**: The resistance presented to the input signals; should be high to avoid loading the source.
4. **Output Impedance**: The resistance at the output; should be low for efficient power transfer.
5. **Bandwidth**: The range of frequencies over which the amplifier operates effectively.
6. **Slew Rate**: The maximum rate of change of the output signal.

#### Application:
Differential amplifiers are commonly used in operational amplifiers (op-amps), instrumentation systems, and audio signal processing, where rejecting noise and amplifying small voltage differences is critical.
